    <h2>Welcome to Replate</h2>
    <p>This is the way you take out your flustrations. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Anything you want to do you can do here. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.</p>

      <p>Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Just make a decision and let it go. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>

      <p>All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Have fun with it.

      <p>Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let all these things just sort of happen.</p>

      <p>We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. What the devil. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.</p>

  <p>I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here.</p>

    <p>If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Isn't that fantastic? We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</p>

    <p>Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Working it up and down, back and forth. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.</p>
